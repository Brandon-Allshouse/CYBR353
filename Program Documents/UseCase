Normal Operation:
New customers visit the registration page, where the system then prompts the user for their information along with a password. The system will then validate this with the requirements before creating the account. Once this is completed, the customer will be granted access to an account with unclassified access and will receive a unique customer ID.
Exception/Remediation:
•	Invalid email format: The system will display an error requesting a valid email address
•	Weak password: The system will prompt the user to enter a stronger password

•	Updated customer order history
Normal Operation:
Once the customer is logged into their account, they will go to the cart page to place the order. The system will calculate the price and then the customer will have to enter their payment information. Once the payment is successful, the system will generate a tracking ID and the package will be added to the customer's order history.
Exception/Remediation: 
•	Invalid login credentials: The customer is prompted to reenter credentials and after 3 failed attempts the account is locked
•	Incomplete package information: The system will highlight the missing information withing the form
•	Invalid delivery address: The system prompts the user to correct the information
•	Payment declined: The system prompts the user to make sure the information provide is accurate and if not then to try a different payment method
•	System timeout: The system will timeout if the customer has not completed the order after 30 minutes

Use Case 3: Track package status
Actors: Established customer, system, package location
Inputs:
•	Customer credentials
•	Tracking ID
Outputs: 
•	Current package status
•	Location information
•	Delivery history timeline
Normal Operations:
The customer will log into their account and then there will be a tracking page that the customer can go to. Once on that page, the customer can enter the tracking ID and then press the tracking page. Once this is completed, the customer will be able to see the tracking information of their package.
Exception/Remediation
•	Invalid tracking ID: The system displays a message saying invalid tracking number
•	Unauthorized access attempt: The system blocks the customer from viewing any information 
•	Package delayed: The system will update with new delivery time
Use Case 4: Assign the driver a route

Inputs:
•	Date for route assignment
•	Available drivers and their information
•	Packages ready for delivery
Outputs:
•	Optimized delivery routes
•	Driver assignments
•	Time estimates
•	Route for each driver
Normal Operation:
Management will log into their account and gain secret clearance in doing so. Management can then select the route assignment page from the dashboard, and it will show all packages that are scheduled for delivery. The algorithm can then process these points and can create routes for each of the drivers which can then be assigned to each driver within this page. The drivers can then view their account and receive their route for the day.
Exception/Remediation
•	Insufficient drivers available: Sends an alert to management and then management decides what to do
•	Optimization route algorithm fails: The system will retry again
•	Driver doesn’t come into work: Routes are recreated by management without including this driver

•	Package tracking ID
•	Current package location
•	Status update
Outputs:
•	Updated package status
•	Timestamp of update
•	Customer notification
•	Update route progress\
Normal Procedures:
The driver will log into their account and once logged in, they can go to the driver's route page. Once on this page, it will show exactly their route for the day and once they drop a package off, there will be a button in which they can click to show that a package was delivered. 
Exception/Remediation:
•	Cannot deliver: Package needs signature so the status is updated
•	Wrong address: Package is returned back to the facility and customer is notified

Use Case 6: Transfer Packages between facilities
Actors: Management, system, inventory system
Inputs: 
•	Facility ID
•	Destination Facility ID
•	Package tracking ID
•	Transport method
Outputs:
•	Updated inventory
•	Package location updates
•	Transfer confirmation
Normal Operation: 
The manager will login with their credentials, gaining secret access. The system will then display all packages that need to be transferred to a new facility. The manager can then click a button to change the status of the packages to “packages are in route”, and then another facility can mark them as delivered. Once these packages are delivered, the system will automatically transfer the inventory to the other facility. 
Exception/Remediation:
•	Package not found during loading/unloading: Management is notified
•	Unauthorized transfer attempt: The system denies operation and notifies management

Use Case 7: Check Facility Inventory
Actors: Management, Inventory System, System
Inputs:
•	Facility ID
•	Admin ID
Outputs: 
•	Inventory Report
Normal operation:
The manager will log in with credentials and gain secret access. The manager can then go to the logs page and request the logs on the inventory. The system will then generate the report and deliver it back to the manager.

Actors: Management, System, Email Service
Inputs:
•	Email
•	Password
•	2FA Code
Outputs:
•	Dashboard Access
Normal operation:
Once the user enters their credentials to gain access to their account, the system will then send an email for 2FA. Once the user receives this email, they will enter the code into the system. After validating this code, the system will allow the user to login. 
Exceptions/Remediation:
•	Invalid credentials: deny access, start attempt counter
•	Too many failures: temporarily lock account and notify account
•	2FA code not matching: deny access to dashboard

Use case 9: Return Package
Actors: System, Established Customer, Management
Inputs: 
•	Original Order ID
•	Facility ID
Outputs:
•	New Order ID
•	Updated Inventory
Normal Operation:
The facility receives return packages with their original order ID included. The package then will be added back into inventory, and the package will get a new order ID to go to its return address.
Exceptions/remediations:
•	Package is given to facility directly without a return address: get original order ID to create return label
•	Item is given to facility unpackaged: item gets packaged and return address printed

Use case 10: Edit Package Information
Actors: Established Customer, System, inventory system
Inputs:
•	Order ID
•	New Package Info
Outputs: 
•	edited package information

The attacker can attempt to exploit the account registration page by injecting malicious SQL commands into the input fields. This could lead to altering data, exposure of data, and access to the database.
Mitigation/Prevention: 
Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all input fields. 
Use parametrized queries to prevent direct SQL command execution.

Misuse Case 2: Impersonation During Login
